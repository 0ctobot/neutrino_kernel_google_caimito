  Userspace client can use to view serial number of panel.
  This value should be unique to each panel device.

KernelVersion: 6.1
Contact: "Taylor Nelms" <tknelms@google.com>
Description:
  Userspace client can use to view or override whether idle mode is
  possible for the panel.
  Idle mode allows the panel to aggressively change its internal refresh rate
  when the panel is expected to be idle for a large length of time.
  Usually, idle mode becomes active when self-refresh mode is activated.

KernelVersion: 6.1
Contact: "Taylor Nelms" <tknelms@google.com>
Description:
  Userspace client uses this to view or override the time delay between the last
  refresh rate change and when idle mode is able to be activated. The panel will
  not enter idle mode until at least this long after the last mode/refresh change.

Contact: "Taylor Nelms" <tknelms@google.com>
Description:
  Userspace client uses this to check whether the flag for the panel needing
  special handling to exit idle mode is on or off, or to override its value.
  Some panels may need special handling when exiting idle mode because of clock or
  bandwidth requirements due to the idle mode TE rate. This file exposes the flag
  controlling this behavior to userspace.

Description:
  Userspace client uses this to view or override the minimum value for vrefresh rate
  that may be entered into without client's involvement, often because of idle mode.
