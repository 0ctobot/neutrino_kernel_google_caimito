	  Say Y here if you have a Google Pixel device. This module enables
	  support for kernel touch drivers to coordinate bus access with remote
	  processors (e.g. sensor DSP processor), which is required to enable
	  low power touch gesture detection in processors other than AP.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called touch_bus_negotiator.
